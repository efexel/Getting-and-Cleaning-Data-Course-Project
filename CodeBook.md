# Data Transformation

The data transformation produced by [run_analysys.R](https://github.com/efexel/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) is described below:


1. The training and the test sets have been merged to create one data set.
1. Only the the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement were extracted into this data set.
1. Activity IDs in the original dataset have been replaced by descriptive activity names.
1. Each variable in the original dataset has been averaged for each unique activity and subject combination.
